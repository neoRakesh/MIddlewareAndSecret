        A secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you
        might use to access a confidential system.
        
        By using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications.
        For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential.
        After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether
        you're authorized to interact with it.
